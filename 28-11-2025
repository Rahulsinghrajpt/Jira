Worked on the ME-4535 Demo Client Data Pipeline Integration Test. Discussed demo client naming conventions with Ravi Pujari and awaited confirmation to proceed. Connected with Manish regarding client metadata, reviewed the temporary table setup, and discussed whether to begin testing with the temporary table or wait for the final metadata deployment. Created a demo client entry in the pipeline infos table.
