Here is a clean 3–4 line timesheet summary:

I completed the Python helper library for the `pipeline_info` table, including 14 functions to manage training schedules, performance metrics, and pipeline updates.
This library will be used across all pipelines and took more time than expected due to detailed logic.
I am writing unit tests to ensure everything works correctly. We are on track to finish the remaining work by tomorrow or latest by Friday.
