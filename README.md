00) Hi Sair. Sir, actually I implemented a logic for schema drift detection, so that if the source (0:09) files that are coming from Tracer, if they have different schema from what is expected, (0:17) so it will give us an alert. And while doing that, there are some bugs in the data ingestion pipeline (0:24) which I tried to fix, but I think I need a little more time to fix that.
So I humbly request you (0:32) to kindly allow me one day time so that I can fix the entire pipeline and make it ready for testing. (0:44) Please provide me just one day exception and tomorrow I will be ready with the data ingestion (0:50) pipeline, so that we can perform the end-to-end testing.
