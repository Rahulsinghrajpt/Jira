Worked on fixing a data ingestion bug in the pipeline. The issue was related to incorrect handling of columns in the ingestion table, where retailer-level fields (such as retailername_spend and impressions) were being mistakenly interpreted as retailer data.

All other columns were passed through and uploaded to the destination bucket without modification. Bug was tested and validated to ensure correct data flow
